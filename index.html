          Animal shelters play a vital role in keeping our pets and cities safe,
          educating the public and providing much needed resources for cities
          dealing with pet over populations. If it were a perfect world, there
          wouldn’t be a need for animal shelters, but until that time, the more
          support we can all give toward their efforts to save, shelter,
          reunite, adopt, improve animal health and educate the public, the
          easier it will be for animal shelters to realize their mission and
          help all animals.
